# Example Developer Guide

This is an example markdown file that demonstrates how Mnemo can be used to load and query documentation.

## Getting Started

Mnemo allows you to load entire documentation sets into Gemini's context cache, enabling natural language queries against your documentation.

## Usage

1. Start the Mnemo server
2. Load your documentation: `mnemo load ./docs my-docs`
3. Query it: `mnemo query my-docs "How do I get started?"`

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation organized in a single directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include code examples where relevant
- Update regularly to keep context fresh
